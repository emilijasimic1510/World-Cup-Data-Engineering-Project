# ⚽ World Cup Data Engineering Project  

Welcome to the **World Cup Data Engineering Project**! 🌍🏆  
This project focuses on **data cleaning, validation, and transformation** of FIFA World Cup match data, using Python and Google Colab.  
The goal is to turn raw historical match records into a **clean, analytics-ready dataset** for insights and reporting.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Pipeline (Workflow)  

The workflow for this project follows a typical **data engineering process**:

1. **Raw Data (CSV)** → Import historical FIFA World Cup matches.  
2. **Data Cleaning** → Handle missing values, duplicates, and enforce constraints.  
3. **Validation** → Apply business rules:
   - No negative goals  
   - Half-time goals ≤ full-time goals  
   - Valid years (1930–2022)  
   - Unique `MatchID` values  
4. **Feature Engineering** → Add new insights:
   - Match results (winner/loser/draw)  
   - Tournament statistics per year  
   - Champion, runners-up, 3rd & 4th place teams  
5. **Output Dataset** → Generate a structured `WorldCup.csv` file for analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates:  

- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing data, validate fields.  
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore unique stages, winners, and team performances.  
- ✅ **Data Transformation**: Aggregate stats (goals, attendance, matches, teams).  
- ✅ **Business Rules Implementation**: Champions, runners-up, and placements per year.  
- ✅ **Data Export**: Final clean dataset ready for BI tools, dashboards, or further analysis.  

🎯 **Skills demonstrated**:  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)  
- Data Engineering (cleaning, validation, transformation)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Building analytics-ready datasets

## 📊 Results  

The final dataset `WorldCup.csv` contains:  

- Year  
- Champion  
- Runners-up  
- Third & Fourth place teams  
- Number of qualified teams  
- Total goals scored  
- Number of matches played  
- Total attendance  

📌 Example insight: "Which country won the most World Cups?" or "How attendance evolved over time."
